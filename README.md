# Homework-BattleShipsLite
BattleShipsLite is a homework project set by IAmTimCorrey. Each of the branches represents an attempt to solve the challenge.

## Project Requirements
To build a small, two-player console game the has its roots in the game Battleship from Mattel. There will be a 25-spot grid (A1-E5). Each player will place fice pegs on the board to represwnt their five ships. Players will then take turnes firing on their opponent's ships. The first person to skink all five ships wins.

##TeachersExampleVersion
This is the version created by Tim Corry as an example for us to compare our finished code to.

## ColinFirstVers
This was my first attempt at the project. I decided to co completely 'off script' and work from the basic requirements without any refrence to what Tim was doing (then look over Tim's version later). When I came to review Tim's version, I realised that I'd written this code in too procedural a fashion.

## ColinSecondVersion
Second try; I've used the first version as a basis (there was a lot about it that I was happy with), but try to change it round to a more object-oriented structure.

## ColinThirdVersion
While working on the second version, I realised that I could improve it further by making each square of the grid an object in it's own right and replacing them with ships when set. I've re-worked this version, almost from scratch to acheive this in the most efficient manner.
